Project Images Directory

Place your project images in this directory and update the image paths in the HTML file.

For example:
- profile-picture.jpg - Your profile picture for the hero section
- project1.jpg - Image for your first project
- project2.jpg - Image for your second project
- project3.jpg - Image for your third project

The portfolio template is designed to work with or without images. If no images are provided, 
the JavaScript will automatically create colored placeholders for the projects.
