Due to market fluctuations and changing technology, reports indicate more than half of employees want to change jobs. How can HR departments understand the needs of new and old employees? Was provided with sample HR data to analyze and find key insights. Upon loading the data, performing the transformations, and establishing the necessary table relationships, I was able to add calculated columns and measures for further analysis. The data revealed that over 70% or employees were under the age of 30 and similarly most employees were hourly. This data was consistent throughout all the regions. After publishing the report to Power BI service, I established role level security with corresponding DAX filters for each region so that managers were only able to access data from their own respective region. ![image](https://github.com/MohitPammu/MohitPammu.github.io/assets/169164184/ad795f85-3ed7-4053-a0d7-5b4859418c1d)
