# FoodHub Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes order data from FoodHub, a food aggregator company that offers access to multiple restaurants through a smartphone app. The analysis explores key patterns in customer behavior, restaurant popularity, cuisine preferences, and delivery metrics to provide strategic recommendations for improving the business.

## Project Context
The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on these restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. FoodHub provides a platform for customers to order online from their favorite restaurants. The app allows restaurants to receive direct online orders from customers and assigns delivery personnel to pick up and deliver the food.

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the demand for different restaurants and cuisines to help enhance the customer experience. The project answers key business questions through exploratory data analysis and statistical methods.
